Tools for the FitLike Reconstruction Processors
-----------------------------------------------
(last updated 09/04/09, Jeanne Wilson, - j.wilson2@physics.ox.ac.uk)

The FitLike processors for Position and Energy reconstruction are driven by MonteCarlo PDFs. The position fitter
requires a root ntuple file input in order to generate PDF histograms of time residuals for different positions
and energies. The energy fitter requires a parameterisation for the mean and sigma of gaussian charge
distributions in terms of energy and vertex position, which is read in from the FIT_LIKE.ratdb file. 

The tools in this directory are used to generate the PDFs (different optic constants, changes in detector
geometry etc. will require new PDFs) and test the fitter. 

* write_scriptcmd_likeposPDFs.perl : Perl script to generate macro and submission scripts to run
	RAT simulations for generation of the time PDF inputs for the FitLikePos position reconstruction processor. 
	Variables set up for Oxford CPU cluster (edit these to run on your system). 
	Each simulation outputs a rootfile containing a simple root Ntuple.

* MergeNtuples.C : Root macro for merging the root Ntuple files created above into one file used as input for
	the FitLikePos processor. 
	
* MakeHists.C : Once a single merged Ntuple file has been created, this root macro can be used to check and plot
	the PDFs that would be generated in RAT.

* write_scriptcmd_likeenergyPDFs.perl : Perl script to generate macro and submission scripts to run
	RAT simulations for generation of the energy PDF inputs for the FitLikeEnergy energy reconstruction processor. 
	Variables set up for Oxford CPU cluster (edit these to run on your system). 
	Each simulation outputs a rootfile containing a simple histogram of total charge for events at a fixed
	position and energy.
	
* ParameteriseQER.C : Root macro that takes the the root histogram files created above and parameterised the
	mean and sigma of the gaussian charge distributions in terms of energy and vertex radius. These
	parameterisations are output in RATDB format and should be entered into the FIT_LIKE.ratdb file. A series of
	plots and chisquared values are also generated to verify the quality of this parameterisation.	

* write_batch_test_suite.perl : Perl script to generate macro and submission scripts for a series of RAT
	simulations to test position and energy reconstruction (compares FitLike to other fitters). Test different
	energy electron events at a series of positions and isotropic.
	
* CompareFit.C : Root macro for analysis of root files created by above jobs. Outputs figures and fitter bias
	and resolution parameters in Latex formate.
