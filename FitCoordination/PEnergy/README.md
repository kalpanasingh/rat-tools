### PEnergy

PEnergy requires "re-coordination" in two circumstances:
   - When there is a change to the 3-d PMT model
   - When there is a change to the scintillator cocktail that results in a
      change in the numbers of scintillation or Cherenkov photons produced
      as a function of event energy.

As of now, documentation and methods are provided only for the first of the
above.  See subdirectory "PMTEffTable".
